# Lua API

The port has two Lua 5.1 states. The game's own scripts (the three start-up scripts and the `.lua` files inside each
stage's data package) run in the game state, which exposes the modules below. A mod reaches that state only by
replacing one of those scripts (see [modding.md](modding.md), "Game scripts"). A mod's `init.lua` runs in a separate
sandboxed state and sees only the `Mod` table described at the end.

Everything here is what the port implements. Functions of the original PS4 game that the port does not implement are
listed under "Stubs": calling them does nothing.

## The game state

The game state is created with the complete Lua 5.1 standard library (`base`, `package`, `string`, `table`, `math`,
`io`, `os`, `debug`), so a replaced game script can read and write files. There is no sandbox here. An error in a game
script is logged as `lua: <error>` with a traceback and the chunk is abandoned; the game goes on.

### How the game calls scripts

The three start-up scripts run once at start, in this order:

1. `/Assets/sh/level_asset/chara/parameter/ShParameterTables.lua`
2. `/Assets/sh/level_asset/chara/gimmick/ShGimmickSetUp.lua`
3. `/Assets/sh/sound/scripts/motion/setup.lua`

When a stage loads, every entry of its `.fpkd` package whose path ends in `.lua` runs, in package order. Each such
script defines a global table named after its file name without the extension (`demoScriptFinishEnding.lua` defines
`demoScriptFinishEnding`), and the game calls functions in those tables:

| call | from | arguments | return |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gameState.OnInit()`, `OnLoadStart`, `OnLoadHallway`, `OnStartOption`, `OnStartLogo`, `OnPreOpeningDemo`, `OnPreGame`, `OnGameOver`, `OnResetGameStopGame`, `OnResetGameUnloadStage`, `OnPreEndingStopGame`, `OnPreEndingUnLoadStage`, `OnLoadEnding`, `OnEnding`, `OnRestartGame` | the game controller's steps; `gameState.lua` lives in the resident package | none | ignored |
| `<scriptFile>.Exec(ctx)` | a trap condition with a `GeoTrapScriptCallbackDataElement` exec, on enter and on leave (not while inside) | one table: `trapFlagString` (`"GEO_TRAP_S_ENTER"`, `"GEO_TRAP_S_OUT"`, else `"GEO_TRAP_S_NONE"`), `conditionHandle` (entity), `trapHandle` (entity), `trapBodyHandle` (body entity) | `true` or `1` marks the condition done |
| `<scriptFile>.OnMessage(script, scriptBody, demoId, message)` | a message reaching a message script entity of a loaded stage | the script entity, its body, the sending demo's id (empty for the controller), the message name | ignored |

`<scriptFile>` is the `scriptFile` property of the entity, reduced to the file name without extension. A missing
table or function is logged as `script: <table>.Exec failed or missing` (or `OnMessage`) and treated as 0.

| `Reset(holder, flag)` | releases it |

### ShParameter

| function | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ReloadParameterTables(table)` | reads the parameter table that `ShParameterTables.lua` builds: its `playerParameter`, `handyLightParameter` and `lightingParameter` children |

### PtDebug (port only)

| function | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `GetEntity(stageLabel, shortName, body)` | the entity of that name in the stage, as a body handle when `body` is true; `nil` when not found |
| `Raycast(height)` | casts 5 m forward from the player's feet raised by `height` (default 1) and logs the hit |
| `DumpCollision(path)` | writes the active collision triangles, traps, connectors and surfaces to a text file |
| `Surface()` | logs the surface material under the player |
| `GetStatus()` | a table: `floor` (name), `floorIndex`, `loop`, `step` and `requestedStep` (the game controller's), `frame`, `time`, `paused`, `streetWalk`, `gamePlus`, `demoSpeed` and `demos` (the ids of the demos playing) |
| `GetStages()` | an array of the loaded stages, the resident package included: `label`, `id`, `package`, `active`, `resident`, `origin` (the stage's world position, a table with `x`, `y`, `z`) |
| `GetEntities(stageLabel, prefix, limit)` | an array of the stage's entities whose short name starts with `prefix` (all with `""`), at most `limit` (default 500): `stage`, `name` (full), `class`, `enable`, `visible`, `geom`, `position`; `nil` without that stage |
| `GetPlayer()` | a table: the feet `x`, `y`, `z`; `yaw` and `pitch` of the view in radians (`yaw` 0 looks along -z); `foxYaw`, the body's; `eye` (`x`, `y`, `z`); `spawned`, `grounded`, `verticalVelocity`, `handyLight` (on or off); and the debug switches below: `hover` (only while one is held), `gravity`, `collision`, `input`, `walkSpeed` |
| `SetPlayerPosition(x, y, z, yaw)` | puts the feet at that point; `yaw` (radians, as `GetPlayer` gives it) is optional and the view keeps its direction without it. During a hover the hover moves to the new height |
| `SetPlayerRotation(yaw, pitch)` | turns the view (radians); `pitch` is optional and is kept within the game's limits, 70° up and 55° down |
| `SetHover(height)` | holds the feet at `height` (the hover above the floor): walking moves only across. `true` holds the current height, `nil` or `false` lets go, and the player falls back to the floor |
| `SetGravity(on)` | `false`: the player no longer falls (walking off an edge keeps the height); stairs and floors still push up |
| `SetCollision(on)` | `false`: walls and floors no longer stop the player, and gravity is off while collision is off. Below y = -70 (except in the ending and on the street) Lisa takes the player, as she does without this switch |
| `SetPlayerInput(on)` | `false`: the player ignores the pad, keyboard and mouse and stands still, for example while `SetCamera` holds the view |
| `SetWalkSpeed(factor)` | the walk speed as a factor of the parameter table's (`moveSpeedRate` in `ShParameterTables.lua`), 0.05 to 20; 1 is the original's |
| `GetHandyLight()` | the flashlight's values under the names `ShParameterTables.lua` uses (`innerRange`, `outerRange`, `temperature`, `lumen`, `lightSize`, `umbraAngle`, `penumbraAngle`, `attenuationExponent`, `dimmer`, `powerScale`, `color` with `r`, `g`, `b`), plus `floorTint` (the colour a floor gives the light, f160's roll for one), `enable`, and `changed` (whether `SetHandyLight` changed it) |
| `SetHandyLight(table)` | changes the values given in `table`, same names as `GetHandyLight`; the others stay. `enable` switches the light on or off. Applies from the next frame |
| `ResetHandyLight()` | the values before the first `SetHandyLight` |
| `GetExposure()` | `row` (the lighting row of the floor), `min`, `max` and `compensation` (EV, with the overrides applied), `floor` (the row's own three), `overridden`, and `ev` while the exposure is pinned |
| `SetExposure(table)` | overrides `min`, `max` and `compensation` (EV) of every floor: a number sets one, `false` gives it back to the floor; `ev` pins the exposure at that EV, `false` releases the pin. `SetExposure(nil)` drops the three overrides |
| `GetCamera()` | the camera the frame is drawn from: `x`, `y`, `z`, `yaw`, `pitch`, `roll` (radians), `fov` (degrees, vertical), `forward` (`x`, `y`, `z`), and `held` (whether `SetCamera` holds it) |
| `SetCamera(table)` | holds the view at a camera of its own, detached from the player, demos included: `x`, `y`, `z`, `yaw`, `pitch` (within ±1.55), `roll`, `fov` (5 to 150 degrees); a missing value stays as the current view has it. `body = false` hides the player's body (shown by default). `SetCamera(nil)` gives the view back. The free camera (F6) and the photo mode (F7) take over the view while they run and give it back to the player when they end; `SetCamera` takes it again |
| `SetDemoSpeed(factor)` | the playback speed of demos, 0 (stopped, the picture holds) to 16; returns the speed before. Sound that is already playing is not paused |
| `SessionState()` | the text the walkthrough tests compare (`sstate`): floor, loop, puzzles, gimmicks and more |

The debug switches stay as set until they are changed again or the game is closed; a new game session does not reset them.
The control channel ([control.md](control.md)) reaches the same functions from a tool outside the game.
They are reached from a replaced game script or from the command line, for example
`pt --lua "600:PtDebug.SetHover(1.0)" --lua "600:PtDebug.SetWalkSpeed(2)"` (each `--lua` runs at that frame).

### Entities

Entity handles are userdata. They come from `Exec` and `OnMessage` arguments, from `GetChildren`, from entity-typed
properties and from `PtDebug.GetEntity`. A "body" handle refers to the same entity's run-time state.

Methods:

| method | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `GetDataBody()`, `GetDataBodyWithReferrer()` | the body handle of the entity |
| `GetChildren()` | a table of the entity's `children` (or `members`) handles, keyed by name, or by index when a child has no name |
| `IsKindOf(className)` | `true` for the entity's class, for `"Entity"`, for `"Data"`, for a body also `"<class>Body"` and `"DataBody"`, and `"Light"` for `PointLight` and `SpotLight` |
| `GetClassName()` | the class name, with `Body` appended for a body handle |
| `GetWorldTransform()` | a table with `translation` (Vector3), `rotQuat` (Quat) and `scale` (Vector3) |
| `Visible()`, `Invisible()` | sets the body's visibility |
| `SetupMessageBox()` | registers the entity as a message receiver |

Fields read with `.`:

| field | value |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | the entity's name |
| `worldTransform` | as `GetWorldTransform()` |
| `enable`, `isVisible`, `isGeomActive` | body handles only: the run-time flags |
| any other name | the entity's data set property of that name: numbers, booleans, strings, paths, other entities, Vector3 values (with the Vector3 metatable), Vector4 and Color values (plain tables with `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`), Quat values. A property that is not a single static value (an array, a list, a string map) comes as a table |

Writing `enable`, `isVisible` or `isGeomActive` on a handle changes the body's flag. Writing any other field is
ignored (logged at debug level). `==` compares two handles by stage, entity and body. `tostring` gives
`Class(name)`. `Entity.IsNull(handle)` is `true` for anything that is not a live handle of a loaded stage.

### Vector3 and Quat

`Vector3(x, y, z)` returns a table with fields `x`, `y`, `z` and the methods `GetX()`, `GetY()`, `GetZ()`.
`Quat(x, y, z, w)` returns a table with `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` (`w` defaults to 1) and the same three getters. Both print
their components with `tostring`. The functions that take a position or a rotation accept any table with those fields.

### Stubs

These exist so the original scripts run. They take any arguments, do nothing and return nothing:

| `Geo` | `GeoLuaSetDebugMaterialColor`, `GeoLuaSetDebugCollisionColor` |
| `AssetConfiguration` | `SetTargetDirectory`, `GetConfigurationFromAssetManager`, `SetDefaultTargetDirectory`, `RegisterExtensionInfo`, `SetDefaultCategory`, `GetDefaultCategory`, `SetLanguageGroupExtention`, `SetGroupCurrentLanguage` |
| `ShGameMainControl` | `GoToLocation`, `StandbyStage` |
| `Pad` | `RegisterButtonAssign`, `RegisterAxisAssign`, `ConfigDefaultAssigns` |

| `EdGraphFactory` | `CreateSetting`, `AddSetting`, `GetInstance`, `DefaultSetting` |
| `UiDaemon` | `SetFontTypeTransTable`, `GetInstance`, `ClearDrawPriorityTable`, `SetDrawPriorityTable`, `SetPrefetchTextureTable` |
| `NavWorldDaemon` | `AddWorld`, `AddScene` |
| `SubtitlesCommand` | `SetVoiceLanguage`, `SetLanguage` |
| `SubtitlesDaemon` | `SetDefaultVoiceLanguage`, `GetDefaultVoiceLanguage` |
| `ShNazoManager` | `SetState` |
| `ShGameStatus` | `RegisterGameFlags`, `GetGameFlag`, `SetGameFlag` |
| `DemoDummyFloorLevel` | `IsMyFloor_FloorName` |
| one function each | `EdDemoEditBlockController.AddToolsBlockPath`, `Preference.GetPreferenceEntity`, `EdAnimGraphControlAdapter.GetInstance`, `Editor.Setting`, `Editor.GetInstance`, `PhDaemon.SetMemorySize`, `PhDaemon.SetMaxRigidBodyNum`, `Script.LoadLibrary`, `EdPreview.GetManager`, `PathMapper.Add`, `EditableBlockPackage.RegisterPackageExtensionInfo`, `CameraPriority.RegisterPriorities`, `CameraSelector.SetMainInstance`, `Pad2.Init`, `ReplayService.Boot`, `NtDaemon.Create`, `FoxTestLuaActor.ExecGlobal`, `MiniPerfView.SetEnable`, `BlockSizeView.SetEnable`, `FoxFadeIo.Create`, `GsRouteDataNodeEvent.SetEventDefinitionPath`, `GsRouteDataEdgeEvent.SetEventDefinitionPath`, `ShLightCapture.InitInstance`, `EdGraphAdapter.Setting`, `DataCluster.GetActorsByClassName`, `DataActor.GetActorsByClassName` |

A stub call is logged at debug level as `lua stub <Module>.<Function>(<args>)`.

## The mod state (init.lua)

Every enabled mod's `init.lua` runs once at start, after the three start-up scripts and before any stage loads, in
mod order (highest priority first, then the folder name that sorts last). All mod scripts share one Lua 5.1 state,
with a separate environment table per mod.

### Available

| | |
| --- | --- |
| base | `assert`, `error`, `ipairs`, `next`, `pairs`, `pcall`, `xpcall`, `select`, `tonumber`, `tostring`, `type`, `unpack`, `rawequal`, `rawget`, `rawset`, `setmetatable`, `getmetatable` (tables only; returns `nil` for anything else), `print` (same as `Mod.Log`), `_G` (the mod's environment), `_VERSION` |
| libraries | own copies of `string`, `table`, `math`, `coroutine`; `os` with only `clock`, `time`, `date`, `difftime` |
| not available | `io`, `debug`, `package`, `load`, `loadstring`, `loadfile`, `dofile`, `require`, `module`, `getfenv`, `setfenv`, `collectgarbage`, `gcinfo`, `newproxy`, the rest of `os` |

### Mod

| member | |
| --- | --- |
| `Mod.Name` | string: the mod's name from `mod.json`, else its folder name |
| `Mod.Log(...)` | converts every argument with `tostring`, joins them with single spaces and writes `mod: <name>: <text>` to `pt.log`. At most 500 lines per mod per run; the 500th line carries a note and further lines are dropped |
| `Mod.On(event, fn)` | adds `fn` as a handler of `event` (one of the four names below). Handlers of one event run in the order they were added. An unknown event name raises an error |
| `Mod.Floor()` | string: the current floor name, for example `"f040"` |
| `Mod.Loop()` | integer: the loop count on the current floor |
| `Mod.Step()` | integer: the game controller's current step; -1 before the game has started. Inside a `StepChange` handler it still returns `old` |

### Events

| event | handler arguments | fired |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FloorEnter` | `floor` (string), `loop` (integer) | when the hallway moves on to the next floor; not for the floor a session starts on |
| `StepChange` | `old` (integer), `new` (integer) | when the controller requests a step other than the one requested before; `old` is the previously requested step |
| `Tick` | `dt` (number, seconds) | every game update; not while paused |
| `Message` | `name` (string), `sender` (string) | when a message is posted to the game's scripts; `sender` is `"controller"` or the sending demo's id |

Handlers run synchronously at the event site, mod by mod in mod order. An event raised while handlers are running is
not delivered to mods.

### Limits

| limit | value |
| --- | --- |
| Lua instructions per call into a mod (`init.lua` itself and each handler call) | 20,000,000 |
| memory for all mod scripts together | 64 MB |
| `Mod.Log` lines per mod per run | 500 |
| precompiled chunks | refused; `init.lua` must be source text |

The first error in a mod (while loading, in `init.lua`, in a handler, over the instruction budget, out of memory, or
an unknown event name) is logged once as `mods: <name>: <error>; this mod's hooks are off until the next start`. That
mod's handlers are removed; the other mods and the game continue.
